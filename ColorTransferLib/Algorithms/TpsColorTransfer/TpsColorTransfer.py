# Based on the paper:
#   Title: L2 Divergence for robust colour transfer
#   Author: Mair√©ad Grogan, Rozenn Dahyot
#   Published in: Computer Vision and Image Understanding
#   Year of Publication: 2019
#
# Abstract:
#   Optimal Transport (OT) is a very popular framework for performing colour transfer in images and videos. We have
#   proposed an alternative framework where the cost function used for inferring a parametric transfer function is
#   defined as the robust L2 divergence between two probability density functions Grogan and Dahyot (2015). In this
#   paper, we show that our approach combines many advantages of state of the art techniques and outperforms many
#   recent algorithms as measured quantitatively with standard quality metrics, and qualitatively using perceptual
#   studies Grogan and Dahyot (2017). Mathematically, our formulation is presented in contrast to the OT cost function
#   that shares similarities with our cost function. Our formulation, however, is more flexible as it allows colour
#   correspondences that may be available to be taken into account and performs well despite potential occurrences of
#   correspondence outlier pairs. Our algorithm is shown to be fast, robust and it easily allows for user interaction
#   providing freedom for artists to fine tune the recoloured images and videos Grogan et al. (2017).
