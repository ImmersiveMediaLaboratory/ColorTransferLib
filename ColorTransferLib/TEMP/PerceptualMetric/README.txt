------------------------------
The Python script model.py provides the function for computing the score of a triple of (input, target, result) images.
------------------------------
The main function style_score in model.py calls four programs, which have been compiled under Fedora for OpenCV 3.0.
The Python script also calls a bash script, for which you need to indicate the path to an installed Matlab version in
model.py beforehand.
------------------------------
Required libraries:
- OpenCV 3.0
- Numpy
- sklearn
- imblearn
